                  Founded in 1992, LK International School By the Sea promotes imaginative thinking through rich, immersive experiences in art, theater, music, and literature. We recognize that children learn best when they feel secure and seen, and that they engage most deeply when their senses are awakened. We focus on developing the whole child including social, emotional, physical, and cognitive skills, all while helping build a love of learning through active play.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  LK International School is unique in the way our teachers and children engage with each other. 
                </p>
                  <p>
                  Unlike other schools, at LK International every single teacher and team member knows each and every family and student on a personal level.  
                  As opposed to having closed classroom units, all of our students interact on the play yard, during morning circle, and our monthly festivals. 
                  This fosters a greater depth of community and connection, as well as cultivates in our children, the understanding that they are part of something bigger than themselves. 
                  This inter-connectedness is the essence of what makes our students grow up to be kind, 
                  upstanding citizens in our world.</p>
